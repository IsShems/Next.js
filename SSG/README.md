1 - create a NextJS project

2 - Add a page /todos in which the todo list taken from the API will be displayed - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

3 - The API request must be made on the server side of the page

4 - Add a dynamic route for the information page of the selected todo element.

5 - You should receive information about the selected location in the server part of the application by request to the API using the id obtained from the dynamic path
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2 - example

6 - Use SSG (server side generation) approach
